Minions like Sir Waffington III and Kernel Von Pop make it harder, while Muffsky Chernikov Sargent Gumbo Gumbull makes it easier.'],

The problem here is that these moves stack together throughout the clown’s four phases to make him a grueling marathon. The first phase is very simple, but in his second phase, you have to avoid balloon dog heads and the rollercoaster that passes by.'],

You have to dodge various projectiles throughout the whole first phase. Getting through this portion unscathed, however, is crucial considering that she has the power to turn you into stone in the second phase.'],

He’s also capable of conjuring sharks, octopus, and shoot wrecking balls from said boat. At first, Brineybeard is an overwhelming foe, simply because he has so many different tools in his arsenal.'],

From the start, it’s maniacal. You have to take out the ray gun attached to its head and two compartments on its frame. The robot’s lower cavity shoots out Galaga-esque ships while the chest cavity unleashes a contraption that creates a perpetual laser from the top of the screen to the bottom that must be parried.'],

These bosses are generally some of the hardest in their respective Isles, simply because you’re forced to dodge much more. You do have a fuller range of motion in flight, but that doesn’t necessarily make the multi-phase fights any easier.'],

Watch carefully to get a feel for how far he jumps before crashing back down. Sometimes Goopy jumps high with short range, and other times he jumps lower with a longer range. This is key to avoiding damage from above. Generally, you can stick near the sides of the screen without fear of getting hit. You will, however, have to dash from time to time if you can tell Goopy will land on the side of the screen.'],
