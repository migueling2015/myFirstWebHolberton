He is played by the second player and can join or leave the game at any time. Due to his deuteragonistic role, Mugman formerly could not be controlled by the first player. However, as of the update in April 2019, the first player can choose to play as him instead."],
    ['<img src="assets/char_baroness_von_bon_bon_big.jpg" alt="Baroness Von Bon Bon" >','Baroness Von Bon Bon','Baroness Von Bon Bon, the lovely candy queen, throws a variety of sweet-toothed minions your way before you have a chance to take her down.he has five minions but you’ll only see three of them per run. Minions like Sir Waffington III and Kernel Von Pop make it harder, while Muffsky Chernikov Sargent Gumbo Gumbull makes it easier.'],
    ['<img src="assets/char_beppi_the_clown_big.jpg" alt="Beppi the clown" >','Beppi the clown','Beppi The Clown has one of the most benign movesets in the game — in isolation. The problem here is that these moves stack together throughout the clown’s four phases to make him a grueling marathon. The first phase is very simple, but in his second phase, you have to avoid balloon dog heads and the rollercoaster that passes by.'],

    ['<img src="assets/char_cala_maria_big.jpg" alt="Cala Maria" >','Cala Maria','Cala Maria, a plane boss, has a solid one-two punch in her first two phases. You have to dodge various projectiles throughout the whole first phase. Getting through this portion unscathed, however, is crucial considering that she has the power to turn you into stone in the second phase.'],
    ['<img src="assets/char_captain_brineybeard_big.jpg" alt="Cap. Brineybeard" >','Captain Brineybeard','Captain Brineybeard has a nice boat that he doesn’t want to share with anyone else at all. He’s also capable of conjuring sharks, octopus, and shoot wrecking balls from said boat. At first, Brineybeard is an overwhelming foe, simply because he has so many different tools in his arsenal.'],
    ['<img src="assets/char_dijimi_the_great_big.jpg" alt="Cap. Brineybeard" >','Dijimi the great','His first two phases have a mix of homing projectiles that are hard to avoid without shrinking your plane. In his coolest phase, Djimmi takes control of a puppet that looks like Cuphead.'],
    ['<img src="assets/char_dr_kahls_robot_big.jpg" alt="Kahls bot" >','Dr. Kahl’s Robot','Dr. Kahl’s Robot is by far the hardest aerial fight in the game. From the start, it’s maniacal. You have to take out the ray gun attached to its head and two compartments on its frame. The robot’s lower cavity shoots out Galaga-esque ships while the chest cavity unleashes a contraption that creates a perpetual laser from the top of the screen to the bottom that must be parried.'],
    ['<img src="assets/char_hilda_berg_big.jpg" alt="Kahls bot" >','Hilda Berf','Some Cuphead bosses take place in the air, with Cuphead commanding an adorable tiny plane. These bosses are generally some of the hardest in their respective Isles, simply because you’re forced to dodge much more. You do have a fuller range of motion in flight, but that doesn’t necessarily make the multi-phase fights any easier.'],

    ['<img src="assets/char_le_grande_big.jpg" alt="" >','Goopy le grande','Goopy is merely a small blob who hops around the screen. Watch carefully to get a feel for how far he jumps before crashing back down. Sometimes Goopy jumps high with short range, and other times he jumps lower with a longer range. This is key to avoiding damage from above. Generally, you can stick near the sides of the screen without fear of getting hit. You will, however, have to dash from time to time if you can tell Goopy will land on the side of the screen.'],
    ['<img src="assets/char_the_root_pack_big.jpg" alt="" >','The root pack','In the first phase, a potato spews clumps of dirt at you. In the second, an onion incessantly cries, forcing you to dodge the tear shower from above. The final phase, a psychedelic carrot, the carrot shoots homing baby carrots in your direction and shoots hypnosis rays from its eyes.'],

In the platforming Crash games, from the original up until Crash of the Titans, if 3 masks are found, Crash becomes invincible for a limited amount of time, with Aku Aku being placed on Crash's face during this period.
